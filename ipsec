conn vpn -- creating a connection with the vpn name

auto=start -- start the connection automatically when the ipsec daemon starts.

type=tunnel -- specifies ipsec to work in tunnel mode. Tunnel
encrypts the original IP packet completely and adds a new IP header. The transport
one encrypts everything above the IP level, and leaves the IP header unchanged.
Roughly speaking, you use tunnel mode to link two
private networks through a public one, while providing encryption (something like
a secure GRE). Transport is relevant when IP connectivity has already been achieved.,
but the traffic between the nodes needs to be encrypted.

authby=secret -- instructs ipsec to authenticate with a key from
the /etc/ipsec.secrets file

left -- specifies the local address (from where we connect)

right -- specifies the remote address (where we are connecting to)

leftsubnet -- local subnets, traffic from which needs to be encrypted

rightsubnet -- remote subnets to which traffic needs to be encrypted

leftprotoport -- local transport protocol for encryption

rightprotoport -- remote transport protocol for encryption

ike -- IPSEC first phase parameters

esp -- IPSEC second phase parameters
